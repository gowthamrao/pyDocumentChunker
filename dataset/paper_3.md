# Machine Learning for Drug Discovery

## Abstract
We explore the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting molecular properties, accelerating the process of drug discovery. Our model, MolGNN, achieves state-of-the-art results on the ZINC dataset.

## 1. Background
Traditional drug discovery is a costly and time-consuming process. Machine learning offers a promising alternative by enabling high-throughput virtual screening of chemical compounds.

### 1.1 Graph Neural Networks
GNNs are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs. They are a natural fit for modeling molecules, which can be represented as molecular graphs.
