# A Study on the Effects of Climate Change on Coral Reefs

## Abstract
This paper analyzes the impact of rising ocean temperatures on coral bleaching events over the past decade. We present a longitudinal study of the Great Barrier Reef.

## 1. Introduction
Coral reefs are vital marine ecosystems. They are currently under threat from anthropogenic climate change.

## 2. Data Collection
Data was collected from 2013 to 2023 using satellite imagery and in-situ temperature sensors. Over 500 distinct reef sites were monitored.
